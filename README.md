# Lightweight Facial Landmark Prediction  
May 2022 â€“ Jun. 2022  
1. Predict facial landmarks using a lightweight 15MB model trained from scratch.  
2. Use [**ConvNext**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545)-like model as backbone  
3. Enhance the lightweight model through [**Deep Mutual Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00384) and **Checkpoint Averaging**.
